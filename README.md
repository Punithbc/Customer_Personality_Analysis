# Customer_Personality_Analysis

Problem Statement:
Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It
helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to
modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different
types of customers.
Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target
customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending
money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a
company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then
market the product only on that particular segment.

The main objective here is -
1. What people say about your product: what gives customers’ attitude towards the
product.
2. What people do: which reveals what people are doing rather than what they are
saying about your product.

# Approach
1) Insertion into Database : MongoDB is used for insertion and retrieval of the dataset used for clustering and training.
2) Data Visualisation : Plotted countplots, barplots, piecharts to get insights about the relation between dependent and independent variables.
3) Feature Engineering : Encoding for categorical features, Scaling is done and PCA has been done to reduce dimensions.
4) Model Building : After clustering, training and prediction are performed
      
web application on our local machine as well as on AWS cloud plateform.
